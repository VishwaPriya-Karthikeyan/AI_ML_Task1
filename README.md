Task 1 â€“ Titanic Dataset Preprocessing

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the AI/ML Internship Program.

Task Objectives Covered:
- Handling null values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Outlier detection (Z-score, boxplots)
- Markdown answers for interview-style questions

File Included:
- `task1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full preprocessing steps on the Titanic dataset

Notes:
- Dataset used: [Titanic Dataset (GitHub Source)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)
- All code is written in Python using pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

This notebook is a part of my learning and internship experience in machine learning and data preprocessing.
